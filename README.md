# test_code
This is the place where I will put some of the code I write with no specific purpose.

## Monty_Hall_Problem.py
This script will execute a defined number of 'iterations' of the Monty Hall problem, 
'switching' or not the initial random choice after uncovering one of the empty doors.
See [Monty_Hall_Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) for more info.

To get help running it:

`python3 Monty_Hall_Problem --help`
